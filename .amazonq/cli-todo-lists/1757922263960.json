The code looks correct with proper error handling.","Found and fixed the bug! The search function was calling self._rowid_to_datetime(rowid) but this method didn't exist, causing an AttributeError that was silently caught and returned 0 results. Fixed by replacing with the same timestamp calculation logic used elsewhere.","The fix is working when testing the database directly (returns 3 results for dijkstra), but the MCP server still returns 0 results. This suggests the running MCP server instance is using a cached/old version and needs to be restarted to pick up the database.py changes."],"modified_files":[],"id":"1757922263960"}
